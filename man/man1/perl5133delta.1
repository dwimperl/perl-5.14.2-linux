.SH "NAME"
perl5133delta \- what is new for perl v5.13.3
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes differences between the 5.13.3 release and
the 5.13.2 release.
.PP
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.13.1, first read
perl5132delta, which describes differences between 5.13.1 and
5.13.2.
.SH "Core Enhancements"
.IX Header "Core Enhancements"
.SS "\eo{...} for octals"
.IX Subsection "o{...} for octals"
There is a new escape sequence, \f(CW"\eo"\fR, in double-quote-like contexts.
It must be followed by braces enclosing an octal number of at least one
digit.  It interpolates as the character with an ordinal value equal to
the octal number.  This construct allows large octal ordinals beyond the
current max of 0777 to be represented.  It also allows you to specify a
character in octal which can safely be concatenated with other regex
snippets and which won't be confused with being a backreference to
a regex capture group.  See \*(L"Capture groups\*(R" in perlre.
.ie n .SS """\eN{\fIname\fP}"" and ""charnames"" enhancements"
.el .SS "\f(CW\eN{\fP\f(CIname\fP\f(CW}\fP and \f(CWcharnames\fP enhancements"
.IX Subsection "N{name} and charnames enhancements"
\&\f(CW\*(C`\eN{}\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`charnames::vianame\*(C'\fR now know about the abbreviated
character names listed by Unicode, such as \s-1NBSP\s0, \s-1SHY\s0, \s-1LRO\s0, \s-1ZWJ\s0, etc., as
well as all the customary abbreviations for the C0 and C1 control
characters (such as \s-1ACK\s0, \s-1BEL\s0, \s-1CAN\s0, etc.), as well as a few new variants
in common usage of some C1 full names.
.PP
In the past, it was ineffective to override one of Perl's abbreviations
with your own custom alias.  Now it works.
.PP
You can also create a custom alias directly to the ordinal of a
character, known by \f(CW\*(C`\eN{...}\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`charnames::vianame()\*(C'\fR, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`charnames::viacode()\*(C'\fR.  Previously, an alias had to be to an official
Unicode character name.  This made it impossible to create an alias for
a code point that had no name, such as the ones reserved for private
use.  So this change allows you to make more effective use of private
use characters.  Only if there is no official name will
\&\f(CW\*(C`charnames::viacode()\*(C'\fR return your custom one.
.PP
See charnames for details on all these changes.
.SS "Uppercase X/B allowed in hexadecimal/binary literals"
.IX Subsection "Uppercase X/B allowed in hexadecimal/binary literals"
Literals may now use either upper case \f(CW\*(C`0X...\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`0B...\*(C'\fR prefixes,
in addition to the already supported \f(CW\*(C`0x...\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`0b...\*(C'\fR
syntax. (RT#76296) (a674e8d, 333f87f)
.PP
C, Ruby, Python and \s-1PHP\s0 already supported this syntax, and it makes
Perl more internally consistent. A round-trip with \f(CW\*(C`eval sprintf
"%#X", 0x10\*(C'\fR now returns \f(CW16\fR in addition to \f(CW\*(C`eval sprintf "%#x",
0x10\*(C'\fR, which worked before.
.SH "Incompatible Changes"

.SS "\e400 \- \e777"
.IX Subsection "400 - 777"
Use of \f(CW\*(C`\e400\*(C'\fR \- \f(CW\*(C`\e777\*(C'\fR in regexes in certain circumstances has given
different, anomalous behavior than their use in all other
double-quote-like contexts.   Since 5.10.1, a deprecated warning message
has been raised when this happens.  Now, all double-quote-like contexts
have the same behavior, namely to be equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`\ex{100}\*(C'\fR \-
\&\f(CW\*(C`\ex{1FF}\*(C'\fR, with no deprecation warning. Use of these values in the
command line option \f(CW"\-0"\fR retains the current meaning to slurp input
files whole; previously, this was documented only for \f(CW"\-0777"\fR.  It is
recommended, however, because of various ambiguities, to use the new
\&\f(CW\*(C`\eo{...}\*(C'\fR construct to represent characters in octal.
(fa1639c..f6993e9).
.SH "Deprecations"
.IX Header "Deprecations"
.SS "Omitting a space between a regular expression and subsequent word"
.IX Subsection "Omitting a space between a regular expression and subsequent word"
Omitting a space between a regex pattern or pattern modifiers and the
following word is deprecated. Deprecation for regular expression
\&\fImatches\fR was added in Perl 5.13.2.  In this release, the deprecation
is extended to regular expression \fIsubstitutions\fR. For example,
\&\f(CW\*(C`s/foo/bar/sand $bar\*(C'\fR will still be parsed as
\&\f(CW\*(C`s/foo/bar/s and $bar\*(C'\fR but will issue a warning. (aa78b66)
.SS "Deprecation warning added for deprecated-in-core .pl libs"
.IX Subsection "Deprecation warning added for deprecated-in-core .pl libs"
This is a mandatory warning, not obeying \-X or lexical warning bits.
The warning is modelled on that supplied by deprecate.pm for
deprecated-in-core .pm libraries.  It points to the specific \s-1CPAN\s0
distribution that contains the .pl libraries. The \s-1CPAN\s0 version, of
course, does not generate the warning. (0111154)
.SH "Performance Enhancements"
.IX Header "Performance Enhancements"
There are several small optimizations to reduce \s-1CPU\s0 cache misses in various very
commonly used modules like \f(CW\*(C`warnings\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`Carp\*(C'\fR as well in accessing
file-handles for reading.

Adds \f(CW\*(C`my_[l]stat_flags()\*(C'\fR to replace \f(CW\*(C`my_[l]stat()\*(C'\fR.  \f(CW\*(C`my_stat()\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`my_lstat()\*(C'\fR call get magic on the stack arg, so create \f(CW\*(C`_flags()\*(C'\fR
variants that allow us to control this. (0d7d409)

Some work has been done on the internal pointers that link between symbol
tables (stashes), typeglobs and subroutines. This has the effect that
various edge cases related to deleting stashes or stash entries (e.g.
<%FOO:: = ()>), and complex typeglob or code reference aliasing, will no
longer crash the interpreter.

Fixed \fIreadline()\fR when interrupted by signals so it no longer returns
the \*(L"same thing\*(R" as before or random memory

Fixed a regression of \fIkill()\fR when a match variable is used for the
process \s-1ID\s0 to kill  (RT#75812) (8af710e)

Fixed several subtle bugs in \fIsort()\fR when \f(CW@_\fR is accessed within a subroutine
used for sorting (RT#72334) (8f443ca)

Bug fixes involving CvGV reference counting break Sub::Name.  A

interrupted by a signal

Test-Harness was updated from 3.17 to 3.21 for this release. A rewrite
in how it handles non-Perl tests (in 3.17_01) broke argument passing to
non-Perl tests with prove (\s-1RT\s0 #59186), and required that non-Perl
tests be run as \f(CW\*(C`prove ./test.sh\*(C'\fR instead of \f(CW\*(C`prove test.sh\*(C'\fR These
issues are being solved upstream, but didn't make it into this release.
They're expected to be fixed in time for perl v5.13.4.  (\s-1RT\s0 #59457)

\&\f(CW\*(C`version\*(C'\fR now prevents object methods from being called as class methods

.SH "Reporting Bugs"
.IX Header "Reporting Bugs"
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl
bug database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be
information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.
.PP
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the \fBperlbug\fR
program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down
to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be
analysed by the Perl porting team.
.PP
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send
it to perl5\-security\-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who be able
to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently
distributed on \s-1CPAN\s0.

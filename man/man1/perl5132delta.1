.IX Title "PERL5132DELTA 1"
.TH PERL5132DELTA 1 "2011-09-26" "perl v5.14.2" "Perl Programmers Reference Guide"
.\" For nroff, turn off justification.  Always turn off hyphenation; it makes
.\" way too many mistakes in technical documents.
.if n .ad l
.nh
.SH "NAME"
perl5132delta \- what is new for perl v5.13.2
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes differences between the 5.13.2 release and
the 5.13.1 release.
.PP
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.10, first read
perl5120delta, which describes differences between 5.10 and
5.12.
.SH "Incompatible Changes"
.IX Header "Incompatible Changes"
.SS "localised tied scalars are tied again."
.IX Subsection "localised tied scalars are tied again."
The change in behaviour in 5.13.1 of localising tied scalar values has
been reverted to the existing 5.12.0 and earlier behaviour (the change for
arrays and hashes remains).
.SS "Naming fixes in Policy_sh.SH may invalidate Policy.sh"
.IX Subsection "Naming fixes in Policy_sh.SH may invalidate Policy.sh"
Several long-standing typos and naming confusions in Policy_sh.SH have
been fixed, standardizing on the variable names used in config.sh.
.PP
This will change the behavior of Policy.sh if you happen to have been
accidentally relying on the Policy.sh incorrect behavior. We'd appreciate
feedback from anyone using Policy.sh to be sure nothing is broken by
this change (c1bd23).
.SS "Stashes are now always defined"
.IX Subsection "Stashes are now always defined"
\&\f(CW\*(C`defined %Foo::\*(C'\fR now always returns true, even when no symbols have yet been
defined in that package.
.PP
This is a side effect of removing a special case kludge in the tokeniser,
added for 5.10.0, to hide side effects of changes to the internal storage of
hashes that to drastically reduce their memory usage overhead.
.PP
Calling defined on a stash has been deprecated since 5.6.0, warned on
lexicals since 5.6.0, and has warned for stashes (and other package
variables) since 5.12.0. \f(CW\*(C`defined %hash\*(C'\fR has always exposed an
implementation detail \- emptying a hash by deleting all entries from it does
not make \f(CW\*(C`defined %hash\*(C'\fR false, hence \f(CW\*(C`defined %hash\*(C'\fR is not valid code to
determine whether an arbitrary hash is empty. Instead, use the behaviour
that an empty \f(CW%hash\fR always returns false in a scalar context.
.SH "Core Enhancements"
.IX Header "Core Enhancements"
.SS "Non-destructive substitution"
.IX Subsection "Non-destructive substitution"
The substitution operator now supports a \f(CW\*(C`/r\*(C'\fR option that
copies the input variable, carries out the substitution on
the copy and returns the result.  The original remains unmodified.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  my $old = \*(Aqcat\*(Aq;
\&  my $new = $old =~ s/cat/dog/r;
\&  # $old is \*(Aqcat\*(Aq and $new is \*(Aqdog\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
This is particularly useful with \f(CW\*(C`map\*(C'\fR.  See perlop for more examples
(4f4d75, 000c65).
.SS "package block syntax"
.IX Subsection "package block syntax"
A package declaration can now contain a code block, in which case the
declaration is in scope only inside that block.  So \f(CW\*(C`package Foo { ... }\*(C'\fR
is precisely equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`{ package Foo; ... }\*(C'\fR.  It also works with
a version number in the declaration, as in \f(CW\*(C`package Foo 1.2 { ... }\*(C'\fR.
See perlfunc (434da3..36f77d, 702646).
.SS "\s-1CLONE_PARAMS\s0 structure added to ease correct thread creation"
.IX Subsection "CLONE_PARAMS structure added to ease correct thread creation"
Modules that create threads should now create \f(CW\*(C`CLONE_PARAMS\*(C'\fR structures
by calling the new function \f(CW\*(C`Perl_clone_params_new()\*(C'\fR, and free them with
\&\f(CW\*(C`Perl_clone_params_del()\*(C'\fR. This will ensure compatibility with any future
changes to the internals of the \f(CW\*(C`CLONE_PARAMS\*(C'\fR structure layout, and that
it is correctly allocated and initialised.
.SS "perl \-h no longer recommends \-w"
.IX Subsection "perl -h no longer recommends -w"
perl \-h used to mark the \-w option as recommended; since this option is
far less useful than it used to be due to lexical 'use warnings' and since
perl \-h is primary a list and brief explanation of the command line switches,
the recommendation has now been removed (60eaec).
.SH "Modules and Pragmata"
.IX Header "Modules and Pragmata"
.SS "Updated Modules"
.IX Subsection "Updated Modules"
\fILocale-Codes 3.13\fR
.IX Subsection "Locale-Codes 3.13"
.PP
Locale::Country, Locale::Language and Locale::Currency were updated from
3.12 to 3.13 of the Locale-Codes distribution to include locale code changes
(e1137b).
.PP
\fIThread-Semaphore 2.11\fR
.IX Subsection "Thread-Semaphore 2.11"
.PP
Added new methods \->\fIdown_nb()\fR and \->\fIdown_force()\fR at the suggestion
of Rick Garlick.

.PP

.IX Subsection "Multiple POD spelling fixes."
.PP
Fixes were made to VMS::DCLsym, mro, Search::Dist, B::t::OptreeCheck
and \s-1UNIVERSAL\s0.
.SH "Changes to Existing Documentation"
.IX Header "Changes to Existing Documentation"
.SS "Replace wrong tr/// table in perlebcdic.pod"
.IX Subsection "Replace wrong tr/// table in perlebcdic.pod"
perlebcdic.pod contains a helpful table to use in tr/// to convert
between \s-1EBCDIC\s0 and Latin1/ASCII.  Unfortunately, the table was the
inverse of the one it describes, though the code that used the table
worked correctly for the specific example given.
.PP
The table has been changed to its inverse, and the sample code changed
to correspond, as this is easier for the person trying to follow the
instructions since deriving the old table is somewhat more complicated.
.PP
The table has also been changed to hex from octal, as that is more the norm
these days, and the recipes in the pod altered to print out leading
zeros to make all the values the same length, as the table that they can
generate has them (5f26d5).
.SS "Document tricks for user-defined casing"
.IX Subsection "Document tricks for user-defined casing"
perlunicode.pod now contains an explanation of how to override, mangle
and otherwise tweak the way perl handles upper, lower and other case
conversions on unicode data, and how to provide scoped changes to alter
one's own code's behaviour without stomping on anybody else (71648f).
.SS "Document $# and $* as removed and clarify $#array usage"
.IX Subsection "Document $# and $* as removed and clarify $#array usage"
$# and $* were both disabled as of perl5 version 10; this release adds
documentation to that effect, a description of the results of continuing
to try and use them, and a note explaining that $# can also function as a
sigil in the $#array form (7f315d2).
.SS "\s-1INSTALL\s0 explicitly states the requirement for C89"
.IX Subsection "INSTALL explicitly states the requirement for C89"
This was already true but it's now Officially Stated For The Record (51eec7).
.SS "No longer advertise Math::TrulyRandom"
.IX Subsection "No longer advertise Math::TrulyRandom"
This module hasn't been updated since 1996 so we can't recommend it any more
(83918a).
.SS "perlfaq synchronised to upstream"
.IX Subsection "perlfaq synchronised to upstream"
The \s-1FAQ\s0 has been updated to commit
37550b8f812e591bcd0dd869d61677dac5bda92c from the perlfaq repository
at git@github.com:briandfoy/perlfaq.git
.SH "Performance Enhancements"
.IX Header "Performance Enhancements"
Only allocate entries for \f(CW@_\fR on demand \- this not only saves memory per
subroutine defined but should hopefully improve \s-1COW\s0 behaviour (77bac2).
.SS "Multiple small improvements to threads"
.IX Subsection "Multiple small improvements to threads"
The internal structures of threading now make fewer \s-1API\s0 calls and fewer
allocations, resulting in noticeably smaller object code. Additionally,
many thread context checks have been deferred so that they're only done
when required (although this is only possible for non-debugging builds).
.SS "Size optimisations to \s-1SV\s0 and \s-1HV\s0 structures"
.IX Subsection "Size optimisations to SV and HV structures"
xhv_fill has been eliminated from struct xpvhv, saving 1 \s-1IV\s0 per hash and
on some systems will cause struct xpvhv to become cache aligned. To avoid
this memory saving causing a slowdown elsewhere, boolean use of HvFILL
now calls HvTOTALKEYS instead (which is equivalent) \- so while the fill
data when actually required is now calculated on demand, the cases when
this needs to be done should be few and far between (f4431c .. fcd245).
.PP
The order of structure elements in \s-1SV\s0 bodies has changed. Effectively,
the \s-1NV\s0 slot has swapped location with \s-1STASH\s0 and \s-1MAGIC\s0. As all access to
\&\s-1SV\s0 members is via macros, this should be completely transparent. This
change allows the space saving for PVHVs documented above, and may reduce
the memory allocation needed for PVIVs on some architectures.
.SS "Optimisation of regexp engine string comparison work"
.IX Subsection "Optimisation of regexp engine string comparison work"
The foldEQ_utf8 \s-1API\s0 function for case-insensitive comparison of strings (which
is used heavily by the regexp engine) was substantially refactored and
optimised \- and its documentation much improved as a free bonus gift
(8b3587, e6226b).
.SS "Memory consumption improvements to Exporter"
.IX Subsection "Memory consumption improvements to Exporter"
The \f(CW@EXPORT_FAIL\fR \s-1AV\s0 is no longer created unless required, hence neither is
the typeglob backing it \- this saves about 200 bytes per Exporter using
package that doesn't use this functionality.
.SH "Installation and Configuration Improvements"
.IX Header "Installation and Configuration Improvements"
.SS "Compilation improvements"
.IX Subsection "Compilation improvements"
Fix \s-1CCINCDIR\s0 and \s-1CCLIBDIR\s0 for mingw64 cross compiler to correctly be under
$(\s-1CCHOME\s0)\emingw\einclude and \elib rather than immediately below $(\s-1CCHOME\s0).
.PP
This means the 'incpath', 'libpth', 'ldflags', 'lddlflags' and
\&'ldflags_nolargefiles' values in Config.pm and Config_heavy.pl are now
set correctly (23ae7f).
.SH "Selected Bug Fixes"

perlbug now always permits the sender address to be changed
before sending \- if you were having trouble sending bug reports before
now, this should fix it, we hope (e6eb90).
.IP "\(bu" 4
Overloading now works properly in conjunction with tied
variables. What formerly happened was that most ops checked their
arguments for overloading \fIbefore\fR checking for magic, so for example
an overloaded object returned by a tied array access would usually be
treated as not overloaded (\s-1RT\s0 #57012) (6f1401, ed3b9b, 6a5f8c .. 24328f).
.IP "\(bu" 4

.Sp
Use the new \f(CW\*(C`find_rundefsv\*(C'\fR function or the \f(CW\*(C`UNDERBAR\*(C'\fR macro instead.
They directly return the right \s-1SV\s0 representing \f(CW$_\fR, whether it's lexical

.IP "\(bu" 4
Omitting a space between a regex pattern or pattern modifiers and the following

.SS "Recent OpenBSDs now use perl's malloc"
.IX Subsection "Recent OpenBSDs now use perl's malloc"
OpenBSD > 3.7 has a new malloc implementation which is mmap based
and as such can release memory back to the \s-1OS\s0; however for perl using
this malloc causes a substantial slowdown so we now default to using

This document describes differences between the 5.13.6 release and

.SS "Single term prototype"
.IX Subsection "Single term prototype"
The \f(CW\*(C`+\*(C'\fR prototype is a special alternative to \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR that will act like
\&\f(CW\*(C`\e[@%]\*(C'\fR when given a literal array or hash variable, but will otherwise
force scalar context on the argument.  This is useful for functions which
should accept either a literal array or an array reference as the argument:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    sub smartpush (+@) {
\&        my $aref = shift;
\&        die "Not an array or arrayref" unless ref $aref eq \*(AqARRAY\*(Aq;
\&        push @$aref, @_;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
When using the \f(CW\*(C`+\*(C'\fR prototype, your function must check that the argument
is of an acceptable type.
.ie n .SS """use re \*(Aq/flags\*(Aq;"""
.el .SS "\f(CWuse re \*(Aq/flags\*(Aq;\fP"
.IX Subsection "use re /flags;"
The \f(CW\*(C`re\*(C'\fR pragma now has the ability to turn on regular expression flags
till the end of the lexical scope:
.PP
.Vb 2

.Ve
.PP
This allows these built-in functions to act on long dereferencing chains
or on the return value of subroutines without needing to wrap them in
\&\f(CW\*(C`@{}\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`%{}\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  push @{$obj\->tags}, $new_tag;  # old way
\&  push $obj\->tags,    $new_tag;  # new way
\&
\&  for ( keys %{$hoh\->{genres}{artists}} ) {...} # old way 
\&  for ( keys $hoh\->{genres}{artists}    ) {...} # new way
.Ve
.PP
For \f(CW\*(C`push\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`unshift\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`splice\*(C'\fR, the reference will auto-vivify
if it is not defined, just as if it were wrapped with \f(CW\*(C`@{}\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Calling \f(CW\*(C`keys\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`values\*(C'\fR directly on a reference gives a substantial
performance improvement over explicit dereferencing.
.PP
For \f(CW\*(C`keys\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`values\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`each\*(C'\fR, when overloaded dereferencing is
present, the overloaded dereference is used instead of dereferencing the
underlying reftype.  Warnings are issued about assumptions made in the
following three ambiguous cases:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  (a) If both %{} and @{} overloading exists, %{} is used
\&  (b) If %{} overloading exists on a blessed arrayref, %{} is used
\&  (c) If @{} overloading exists on a blessed hashref, @{} is used

The \f(CW\*(C`/r\*(C'\fR flag, which was added to \f(CW\*(C`s///\*(C'\fR in 5.13.2, has been extended to
the \f(CW\*(C`y///\*(C'\fR operator.
.PP
It causes it to perform the substitution on a \fIcopy\fR of its operand,
returning that copy instead of a character count.
.ie n .SS "New global variable ""${^GLOBAL_PHASE}"""
.el .SS "New global variable \f(CW${^GLOBAL_PHASE}\fP"
.IX Subsection "New global variable ${^GLOBAL_PHASE}"
A new global variable, \f(CW\*(C`${^GLOBAL_PHASE}\*(C'\fR, has been added to allow
introspection of the current phase of the perl interpreter. It's explained in
detail in \*(L"${^GLOBAL_PHASE}\*(R" in perlvar and
\&\*(L"\s-1BEGIN\s0, \s-1UNITCHECK\s0, \s-1CHECK\s0, \s-1INIT\s0 and \s-1END\s0\*(R" in perlmod.
.SS "Unicode Version 6.0 is now supported (mostly)"
.IX Subsection "Unicode Version 6.0 is now supported (mostly)"
Perl comes with the Unicode 6.0 data base updated with
Corrigendum #8 <http://www.unicode.org/versions/corrigendum8.html>,
with one exception noted below.
See <http://unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.0.0> for details on the new
release.  Perl does not support any Unicode provisional properties,
including the new ones for this release, but their database files are
packaged with Perl.
.PP
Unicode 6.0 has chosen to use the name \f(CW\*(C`BELL\*(C'\fR for the character at U+1F514,
which is a symbol that looks like a bell, and used in Japanese cell
phones.  This conflicts with the long-standing Perl usage of having
\&\f(CW\*(C`BELL\*(C'\fR mean the \s-1ASCII\s0 \f(CW\*(C`BEL\*(C'\fR character, U+0007.  In Perl 5.14,
\&\f(CW\*(C`\eN{BELL}\*(C'\fR will continue to mean U+0007, but its use will generate a
deprecated warning message, unless such warnings are turned off.  The
new name for U+0007 in Perl will be \f(CW\*(C`ALERT\*(C'\fR, which corresponds nicely
with the existing shorthand sequence for it, \f(CW"\ea"\fR.  \f(CW\*(C`\eN{BEL}\*(C'\fR will
mean U+0007, with no warning given.  The character at U+1F514 will not
have a name in 5.14, but can be referred to by \f(CW\*(C`\eN{U+1F514}\*(C'\fR.  The plan
is that in Perl 5.16, \f(CW\*(C`\eN{BELL}\*(C'\fR will refer to U+1F514, and so all code
that uses \f(CW\*(C`\eN{BELL}\*(C'\fR should convert by then to using \f(CW\*(C`\eN{ALERT}\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`\eN{BEL}\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW"\ea"\fR instead.
.SS "Improved support for custom OPs"
.IX Subsection "Improved support for custom OPs"
Custom ops can now be registered with the new \f(CW\*(C`custom_op_register\*(C'\fR C
function and the \f(CW\*(C`XOP\*(C'\fR structure. This will make it easier to add new
properties of custom ops in the future. Two new properties have been added
already, \f(CW\*(C`xop_class\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`xop_peep\*(C'\fR.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`xop_class\*(C'\fR is one of the OA_*OP constants, and allows B and other
introspection mechanisms to work with custom ops that aren't BASEOPs.
\&\f(CW\*(C`xop_peep\*(C'\fR is a pointer to a function that will be called for ops of this
type from \f(CW\*(C`Perl_rpeep\*(C'\fR.
.PP
See \*(L"Custom Operators\*(R" in perlguts and \*(L"Custom Operators\*(R" in perlapi for more
detail.
.PP
The old \f(CW\*(C`PL_custom_op_names\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`PL_custom_op_descs\*(C'\fR interface is still
supported but discouraged.
.SH "Incompatible Changes"
.IX Header "Incompatible Changes"
.SS "Dereferencing typeglobs"
.IX Subsection "Dereferencing typeglobs"
If you assign a typeglob to a scalar variable:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $glob = *foo;
.Ve
.PP
the glob that is copied to \f(CW$glob\fR is marked with a special flag
indicating that the glob is just a copy. This allows subsequent assignments
to \f(CW$glob\fR to overwrite the glob. The original glob, however, is
immutable.
.PP
Many Perl operators did not distinguish between these two types of globs.
This would result in strange behaviour in edge cases: \f(CW\*(C`untie $scalar\*(C'\fR
would do nothing if the last thing assigned to the scalar was a glob
(because it treated it as \f(CW\*(C`untie *$scalar\*(C'\fR, which unties a handle).
Assignment to a glob slot (e.g., \f(CW\*(C`(*$glob) = \e@some_array\*(C'\fR) would simply
assign \f(CW\*(C`\e@some_array\*(C'\fR to \f(CW$glob\fR.
.PP
To fix this, the \f(CW\*(C`*{}\*(C'\fR operator (including the \f(CW*foo\fR and \f(CW*$foo\fR forms)
has been modified to make a new immutable glob if its operand is a glob
copy. Various operators that make a distinction between globs and scalars
have been modified to treat only immutable globs as globs.
.PP
This causes an incompatible change in code that assigns a glob to the
return value of \f(CW\*(C`*{}\*(C'\fR when that operator was passed a glob copy. Take the
following code, for instance:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    $glob = *foo;
\&    *$glob = *bar;
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW*$glob\fR on the second line returns a new immutable glob. That new
glob is made an alias to \f(CW*bar\fR. Then it is discarded. So the second
assignment has no effect.
.PP
It also means that \f(CW\*(C`tie $handle\*(C'\fR will now tie \f(CW$handle\fR as a scalar, even
if it has had a glob assigned to it.
.PP
The upside to this incompatible change is that bugs

.SS "Clearing stashes"
.IX Subsection "Clearing stashes"
Stash list assignment \f(CW\*(C`%foo:: = ()\*(C'\fR used to make the stash anonymous
temporarily while it was being emptied. Consequently, any of its
subroutines referenced elsewhere would become anonymous (showing up as
\&\*(L"(unknown)\*(R" in \f(CW\*(C`caller\*(C'\fR). Now they retain their package names, such that
\&\f(CW\*(C`caller\*(C'\fR will return the original sub name if there is still a reference

it to perl5\-security\-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who be able
to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
